        <h4 id="about">About Me: Aaron Wade</h4>

        <p>I grew up in a town called Franklin, KY. My whole life I have loved music and sports. I've sung in many choirs over the years and am currently a member of the BYU Men's Chorus. I served a mission in the Texas Houston East Spanish-speaking Mission. I am currently taking pre-business classes at BYU.</p>

        <p class="verse">"I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live ny the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me." -Galatians 2:20</p>
        <p>This verse means a lot to me because it radiates Jesus's love for me and for all of us. It highlights the principle of grace and of being born again. It reminds me that I need to  rely on my Savior to help me become a new creature and receive a change of heart so that I can become more like Him.</p>
